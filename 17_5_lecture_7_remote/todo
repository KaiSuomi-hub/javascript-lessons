So you want to create a new account!
Let’s start with the easy question. What is your name?
Dan Ackers
Hey Dan Ackers! It’s create to have you as a client.
How much cash do you want to deposit to get started with your account? (10€ is the minimum)
8
Unfortunately we can’t open an account for such a small account. Do you have any more cash with
you?
12
Great Dan Ackers! You now have an account (ID: 1) with balances of 12€.
We’re happy to have you as a customer, and we want to ensure that your money is safe with us. Give
us a password, which gives only you the access to your account.

const account = {
	name: "Dan Ackers",
	password: "HappyCrappy",
	id: 1,
	balance: 12,
	fundRequests: []
}

Now when you exit the command line, you’ll notice that all the data is gone. Store all the data from the
application in to a json file, and always reload it when you restart the program. This way you will never lose
the valuable accounts of your bank.
